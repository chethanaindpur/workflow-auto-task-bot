Workflow Auto-Task Bot
Founder Operations Assistant
Problem:

Early-stage startups and growing teams often track operational tasks in spreadsheets.
However, founders lack structured visibility into:

Upcoming deadlines

Overdue responsibilities

High-priority tasks

Execution bottlenecks

This leads to operational overload and missed follow-ups.

Solution:

Workflow Auto-Task Bot is a Python-based automation prototype that:

Scans task data

Identifies deadlines within a defined alert window

Flags overdue tasks

Highlights high-priority execution items

The system improves visibility, accountability, and structured workflow management.
